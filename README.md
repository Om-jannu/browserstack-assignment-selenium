# BrowserStack Selenium Web Scraping

This Python project leverages Selenium and BrowserStack to perform web scraping tasks. It allows users to automate web interactions and extract desired information from web pages using BrowserStack's Selenium grid.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Om-jannu/browserstack-assignment-selenium.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd browserstack-assignment-selenium
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

<!-- ## Configuration

Before running the scripts, make sure to set up your BrowserStack account credentials and configure the desired web scraping parameters in the `config.py` file. Update the following variables:

- `BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME`: Your BrowserStack username.
- `BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY`: Your BrowserStack access key.
- `URL_TO_SCRAPE`: The URL of the website you want to scrape.
- `XPATH_SELECTOR`: The XPath selector for the element(s) you want to extract. -->

## Usage

Run the main script `main.py` to initiate the web scraping process:
```
python main.py
```

<!-- The script will launch a BrowserStack session, navigate to the specified URL, extract the desired information using the provided XPath selector, and save the results to a CSV file named `output.csv`. -->

<!-- ## Example

Here's an example of how to use this project:

1. Set up your BrowserStack credentials and configure the scraping parameters in `config.py`.
2. Run the `webscraper.py` script.
3. Check the `output.csv` file in the project directory for the extracted data. -->

## Notes
